# AI Implementation Journey Application

## Overview
The AI Implementation Journey application is a comprehensive platform designed to guide organizations from having no AI to being AI-ready with a solid implementation plan. The application provides a step-by-step process with tangible deliverables at each stage, helping organizations assess their AI readiness, identify opportunities, and create a strategic implementation plan.

## Features
- User authentication and organization management
- Project creation and management
- 12-step guided AI implementation journey
- AI potential assessment for workflows and tasks
- Intelligent tool recommendations based on organizational needs
- Visual process mapping
- Phased implementation planning
- Data visualization and insights
- Comprehensive reporting

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Storage)
- **AI Engine**: Custom JavaScript implementation for assessment and recommendations
- **Visualization**: Chart.js for data visualization

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Supabase account (for database and authentication)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/ai-journey-app.git
   cd ai-journey-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory with the following variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

4. **Set up the database**
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Run the SQL script in `database-schema.sql` to create the necessary tables and relationships

5. **Start the development server**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Build for production**
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
